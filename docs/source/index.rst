Segpy
=====

*Segpy* is a Python package for reading and writing SEG Y data. The SEG Y file format is one of several standards
developed by the Society of Exploration Geophysicists for storing geophysical seismic data. It is an open standard, and
is controlled by the SEG Technical Standards Committee, a non-profit organization.

This project aims to implement an open SEG Y module in Python for transporting seismic data between SEG Y files and
Python data structures.
