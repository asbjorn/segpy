How to contribute
=================

Third-party patches are welcomed for improving Segpy. We simply can't
access the huge variety of SEG Y files produced by a myriad of other
systems.

Although we want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
get things working in your environment, there are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.


Getting Started
===============

The easiest way to help is by submitting issues reporting defects or
requesting additional features.

* Make sure you have a `GitHub account <https://github.com/signup/free>`_
* Submit an issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you mention the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub


Making Changes
==============

* You must own the copyright to the patch you're submitting, and be in a
  position to transfer the copyright to Sixty North by agreeing to the either
  the `Individual Contributor License Agreement <https://github.com/sixty-north/segpy/raw/master/docs/source/legal/segpy-individual-cla.pdf>`_
  (for private individuals) or the `Entity Contributor License Agreement <https://github.com/sixty-north/segpy/raw/master/docs/source/legal/segpy-entity-cla.pdf>`_
  (for corporations or other organisations).
* Make small commits in logical units.
* Ensure your code is in the spirit of `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_,
  although we accept that much of what is in PEP 8 are guidelines
  rather than rules, so we value readability over strict compliance.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with ``git diff --check`` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format::


    Issue #1234 - Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete

    Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING
    document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the
    contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
    based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the
    problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with an issue number
    from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,
    why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.


* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run **all** the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

Making Trivial Changes
======================

Documentation
-------------

For changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not
always necessary to create a new issue. In this case, it is appropriate
to start the first line of a commit with 'Doc -' instead of an issue
number::

    Doc - Add documentation commit example to CONTRIBUTING

    There is no example for contributing a documentation commit
    to the Segpy repository. This is a problem because the contributor
    is left to assume how a commit of this nature may appear.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with 'Doc -' in
    place of what would have been the ticket number in a
    non-documentation related commit. The body describes the nature of
    the new documentation or comments added.

Submitting Changes
==================

* Agree to the `Individual Contributor License Agreement <https://github.com/sixty-north/segpy/raw/master/docs/source/legal/segpy-individual-cla.pdf>`_
  or the `Entity Contributor License Agreement <https://github.com/sixty-north/segpy/raw/master/docs/source/legal/segpy-entity-cla.pdf>`_
  by attaching a copy of the current CLA to an email (so we know which
  version you're agreeing to). The body of the message should contain
  the text "I, <your name>, [representing <your company>] have read the
  attached CLA and agree to its terms."  Send the email to rob@sixty-north.com
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the sixty-north organization.
